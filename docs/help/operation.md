## Move the cursor and select text

-  Dragging with the left mouse button strokes out a selection between the insertion cursor and the character under the mouse.

-  Dragging after a triple click will stroke out a selection consisting of whole lines.

-  The ends of the selection can be adjusted by dragging with the left mouse button while `Shift` is down; this will adjust the end of the selection that was nearest to the mouse cursor when the left button was pressed.
-  If the button is double-clicked before dragging then the selection will be adjusted in units of whole words; if it is triple-clicked then the selection will be adjusted in units of whole lines.
-  Clicking the left mouse button with `Ctrl` down will reposition the insertion cursor without affecting the selection.

-  `Ctrl`-`Left` and `Ctrl`-`Right` move the insertion cursor by words
-  `Ctrl`-`Shift`-`Left` and `Ctrl`-`Shift`-`Right` move the insertion cursor by words and also extend the selection.

-  `Up` and `Down` move the insertion cursor one line up or down and clear any selection in the text. 
-  If `Up` or `Down` is typed with `Shift` down, then the insertion cursor moves and the selection is extended to include the new characters. 

-  `PgUp` and `PgDn` move the insertion cursor forward or backwards by one screenful and clear any selection in the text. 
-  If `Shift` is held down while `PgUp` or `PgDn` is typed, then the selection is extended to include the new characters. 

-  `Home` moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of its line and clears any selection. 
-  `Shift`-`Home` moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of the line and also extends the selection to that point.

## Modify text

-  If any normal printing characters are typed, they are inserted at the point of the insertion cursor.
-  `Del` deletes the selection, if any. Otherwise, it deletes the character to the right of the insertion cursor.
