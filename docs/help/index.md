# User guide

This page refers to the latest 
[nv_writer](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_writer/) release.

The plugin adds an **Write in distraction free mode** entry to both 
the *novelibre* **Section** menu and the section context menu. 

---

## Start the distraction free writing mode

- Select the section to start with (optional). If no section is selected in the project tree, the first section will be opened.
- To enter the distraction free editing mode, either 
   - hit `Ctrl`-`W`, or
   - right-click the selected section and select **Write in distraction free mode**, or 
   - click **Section > Write in distraction free mode**.

> **Important**
>
> In order to avoid confusion, the distraction-free editor will not start, if either 
> - an editable manuscript exists, or
> - the project is locked. 
>
> So if yo have a regular manuscript or a manuscript for third-pary word processing, 
> you may want to discard it after updating your *novelibre* project.

## End the distraction-free writing mode

- Hit `Alt`-`F4` (Windows) or `Ctrl`-`Q` (Linux) to finish the editing session.

> **Hint**
>
> Unlike *Writer*, the distraction-free editor does not automatically replace quotation marks, dashes, etc.
> Typographical adjustments must therefore be made in a proofreading process on the regular manuscript using *Writer*.
> I recommend one of the [curly](https://peter88213.github.io/curly/) extensions for this purpose.
