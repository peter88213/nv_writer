# Options


With **Tools > Distraction-free writing plugin Options**,
you can open the options dialog box.

---

## Apply changes

When switching between sections, or when leaving the distraction free writing mode, 
changes of the section content will be applied to the *novelibre* project. 

If the **Ask for confirmation** checkbox is checked, you will be asked for confirmation. 

> **Note**
>
> *Applying changes* does not save your current project on disk, but update it in memory,
> and set the change notification in the *novelibre* footer bar.
> To save changes while in distraction-free writing mode, press `Ctrl`-`S`.

## Word count

By default, word count is updated manually by pressing the `F5` key.

If the **Live update** checkbox is checked, the word count can be updated "live", 
i.e. just while entering text.

> **Note**
>
> Live updating the word count is resource intensive and may slow down
> the program when editing big sections. This is why it’s disabled by default.

## Color sets

You can select a color set (theme) by clicking on the button below the preview.
